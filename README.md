üõ©Ô∏è VTOL Precision Landing Simulator

A Streamlit app that simulates precision landings for eVTOL / Hybrid VTOL aircraft in confined spaces using:
	‚Ä¢	RTK GNSS (centimeter XY)
	‚Ä¢	Lidar (centimeter Z near ground)
	‚Ä¢	Vision targets (ArUco / AprilTag) for pad-relative lock
	‚Ä¢	Kalman filtering (constant-velocity XY smoothing)
	‚Ä¢	3D Landing Cone, scoring, and an Auto-Tuner with one-click Apply Best Settings

‚ö†Ô∏è Simulation for education & prototyping only. Not flight software.

‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	eVTOL Dataset (preloaded): Vector, WingtraOne, DeltaQuad Pro, Urban Hawk (custom)
	‚Ä¢	RTK vs GPS Drift: toggle fix; inject wind/gps glitches
	‚Ä¢	Lidar vs Baro altitude comparison (drift removal below ~5‚Äì10 m AGL)
	‚Ä¢	Vision Assist: ArUco/AprilTag size model, lock threshold & dwell, illumination/blur/occlusion controls
	‚Ä¢	3D Landing Cone: visualize allowable corridor from 10 m AGL to touchdown
	‚Ä¢	In-place Playback Animation: clean, single-plot animation (no stacked graphs)
	‚Ä¢	Kalman Filter (CV): smoother XY path and better touchdown error
	‚Ä¢	Landing Success Score: XY error, Z/vertical speed, cone compliance, vision lock stability
	‚Ä¢	Auto-Tuner: random search for high scores; Apply Best Settings updates all sliders instantly
üîß Modules & Models

RTK vs GPS (XY)
	‚Ä¢	RTK fix ‚Üí œÉ‚âà3 cm scatter; No RTK ‚Üí œÉ‚âà1‚Äì1.5 m
	‚Ä¢	Optional wind bias and GPS glitch spike

Lidar vs Barometer (Z)
	‚Ä¢	Barometer: slow drift over time
	‚Ä¢	Lidar: centimeter-level Z near ground; used primarily below ~5‚Äì10 m AGL

Vision Assist (ArUco / AprilTag)
	‚Ä¢	Pinhole model estimates marker pixel size:
px ‚âà f_px * (marker_size_m / altitude_m)
	‚Ä¢	Lock when pixel size ‚â• threshold for N dwell frames
	‚Ä¢	Sliders for illumination, motion blur, occlusion to stress test detection
	‚Ä¢	Print your ArUco marker from the app (PNG download); pick a size that reaches pixel-threshold at your intended lock altitude

Kalman Filter (XY)
	‚Ä¢	Constant-velocity (CV) model; measurement noise decreases when vision lock is active
	‚Ä¢	Smooths raw GNSS path and improves touchdown XY error

3D Landing Cone
	‚Ä¢	Tapered corridor: ~1 m radius at 10 m AGL ‚Üí 0 at pad
	‚Ä¢	Live overlay in 2D (allowed radius ring) + 3D wireframe trace

üßÆ Scoring

Landing Success Score (0‚Äì100) blends:
	‚Ä¢	XY touchdown error (target ‚â§ 0.20 m)
	‚Ä¢	Vertical speed at touchdown (target ‚â§ 0.5 m/s)
	‚Ä¢	Cone violation rate (fraction of frames outside allowed radius)
	‚Ä¢	Lock stability in final 30% of the approach

Weighting is documented in landing_score(m). Tune as needed.

ü§ñ Auto-Tuner
	‚Ä¢	Random search over:
	‚Ä¢	Beacon/vision correction gain
	‚Ä¢	Lock threshold (px) & dwell (frames)
	‚Ä¢	Kalman q (process noise) & R base (GNSS œÉ)
	‚Ä¢	Averages multiple random seeds ‚Üí mean score
	‚Ä¢	Shows top results and a one-click ‚ÄúApply Best Settings‚Äù button to push the winner back into the sidebar controls (via st.session_state)
	‚Ä¢	Rerun playback to validate

üß† Tips
	‚Ä¢	Too many graphs? Stream uses a single placeholder for animation ‚Äî no stacking.
	‚Ä¢	No vision lock? Increase marker size or reduce HFOV; boost illumination; reduce blur/occlusion; lower pixel threshold or raise dwell.
	‚Ä¢	Wobbly path? Increase lock_dwell_frames; raise Kalman q slightly if lagging, or lower q if noisy.
	‚Ä¢	Confined pads: use higher beacon gain once locked and verify cone compliance.

‚ùì FAQ

Q: Can I use my own camera params?
A: Yes ‚Äî set your camera width/height & HFOV in the sidebar. The pixel model uses those directly.

Q: Does AprilTag require a camera?
A: This sim emulates detection behavior. For real detection, integrate your video feed and pose estimator (outside scope here).

Q: Can I log and export runs?
A: Yes ‚Äî Download Playback CSV after each run.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
	‚Ä¢	OpenCV errors on macOS (M1/M2): try opencv-contrib-python (non-headless) or install via conda-forge.
	‚Ä¢	AprilTag install issues (Windows): comment it out in requirements.txt and use ArUco.
	‚Ä¢	Streamlit Cloud memory/timeouts: reduce Playback Steps and Auto-Tuner Trials.

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
	‚Ä¢	Real-time camera input with live ArUco/AprilTag detection
	‚Ä¢	Beacon array / multi-target blending
	‚Ä¢	3D vehicle dynamics and wind fields
	‚Ä¢	SITL bridge (ArduPilot) for HIL demos
	‚Ä¢	Scenario presets (rooftop / ship deck / clearing)
